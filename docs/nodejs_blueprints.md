# Purpouse

The aim of these projects is to create a repository of blueprints to use in our future project. Furthermore, it will increase the knowledge about NodeJS/Express apps. To accomplish each project follow these guidelines:

1. Each project should be uploaded to the authors personal Github account
2. Each line of relevant code should be commented. Despite of that this is not a __clean code__ practice; we'll do that to check that the student understands how the code works
3. The student should modify this Singusaurus page for the given project:
   1. His/her name an a link to the Github project
   2. A snapshot of the app
   3. A resume of what the student has learned implementing the blueprint


Note: Most of this are guided tutorials. The __difficulty__ statement tries to measure how difficult is to try to understand the subject of the tutorial by your own.

## Example Blueprint: Use the handlebars template engine to write a simple NodeJS/Express app: Difficulty Easy

Use the handlebars template engine to write a simple app. Follow this tutorial

### Author

- [Oscar Miras](https://github.com/omiras/)
- [Github project](https://github.com/omiras/blueprint-handlebars-nodejs)

### Summary

1. I was able to use the handlebars engine to render a simple NodeJS/Express app
2. I updated some of the packages because in the example they were way outdated
3. I learned that handlebars works slightly different than others template engines. You can define the skeleton of your HTML and the engine will replace the __body__ with another .hbs file; depending on the part of the website/app you want to render. 

## Use some library to create an app with geospatial manipulation data. Difficulty: High

Prerequisites: you may need to learn about how Sockets work to implement this - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soerr09FYCw)

Follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy89Nj7tNNM). It also includes Socket manipulation. 

## Use express-validator to perform some server-side validation. Difficulty: Medium

Follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE5zeEiVqpw). It is funny to watch Maximilian 5 years ago :). It also includes some __session__ practice. Be aware that some of the libraries may be outdated by now and you must do use them slightly different. Also, it is fun because it uses the __handlebeas__ engine. 

## Use a third-party library to send emails. Difficulty: Easy

Use the well-known __nodemailer__ library to learn how to send emails with NodeJS. [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu-1LpCyu1Y).


## Write an app that use cookies to send exchange information between client and server - Difficulty: Medium

* Follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2so3hh8n-3w) to implement a simple cookie exchange between client and server
* Lean the difference between local storage, session storage and cookies - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GihQAC1I39Q)

## Write an app that implements custom  authentication with session - Difficulty: Medium

Follow this tutorial to implement custom authentication. It also includes how session works in NodeJS - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud5xKCYQTjM)

## Write an app that implement session authentication with Google - difficulty: Medium

Follow this tutorial to implement authentication using Google - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2ec4KQ7mP8)

## Write an app that implement custom authentication using Passport library - difficulty: Medium

Follow this tutorial to implement authentication using the Passport library  - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RCnNyD0L-s)

## Figure out how to stream video with Sockets - Difficulty: High

Prerequisites: you may need to learn about how Sockets work to implement this - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soerr09FYCw)

[Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvlyzDZDEq4&t=1554s)

## Implement a real-time chat. Difficulty: Medium

Prerequisites: you may need to learn about how Sockets work to implement this - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soerr09FYCw)

[Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzOqP9YwmM)

### Author

- [Marc Bellido](https://github.com/mbellydo)
- [Github project](https://github.com/mbellydo/real-time-chat-app)

### Summary

1. I was able to learn how to use the sockets library
2. I learned that with sockets can create a two-way communication app, a link between two programs running on the network.

## Write some automated tests for a given app (or use TDD to create an app). Difficulty: Medium

[Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9HdJ8P6GQI)

## Consume a REST API from a server-side app. Two projects: custom implementation and using node-fetch package

Learn how to consume a REST API from a NodeJS App implementing an app to retrieve weather data - [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtLVbJk7KcM) 

## Find some useful boilerplates for common NodeJS/Express apps - Difficulty: Easy

Attach some links with useful boilerplates to build NodeJS/Express/MongoDB application

1. Boilerplate that uses MVC pattern
2. Boilerplate that takes into account SCSS files
3. Webpack-ready boilerplates

## 4 Projects - Practice App and Site building in general - Difficulty: varies

It is very common that companies ask candidates to implement an application with some requirements. 

In Freecodecamp there is a [comprehensive list](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/#take-home-projects) of common to-do projects that you may be asked to code in a given technology.

You can try to implement the project by your own; or just grab the code from CodePen and comment each relevant piece of code; as required for these blueprints.
